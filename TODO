TODO might be nice to show left and right values when assertion fails
TODO it seems like the more lessons are solved the slower the meditate runner runs
TODO String.repeat/2 and String.upcase/1 example might work better with upcase form missing
TODO why isn't Integer.is_odd/1 a predicate function?
TODO meditate runner does not recover from error in koan
TODO add lesson about character lists
TODO illustrate return value of Integer.parse/2 includes unparsable bits of string
TODO illustrate how Integer.parse/1 handles decimal values
TODO update Float.parse/1 with unparsable bits to actually be a float
TODO maybe pull Range stuff out of numbers koan into it's own module
TODO not a huge fan of Range lessons in general. X..Y is idiomatic range creation...
TODO first tuple lesson feels a little pointless
TODO not a fan of List.first/1 being initial exposure to first element of list. pattern matching greatly preferred
TODO the initial example of List.delete is confusing because the element value and index are the same
TODO add example of List.wrap(nil)
TODO update last keyword list example to show "else" case
